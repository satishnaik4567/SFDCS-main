### How to set up
1. Install Python 3.7, make sure to precompile standard libraries as well as add it to system path (ONLY version 3.7, since later versions may break support for the tensorflow package that actually works)
2. Make sure you have the Spinach Images Dataset downloaded.
3. Install the exact versions of packages mentioned within requirements.txt

Go into terminal/cmd within the project folder and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`, it will install all the required packages for the project.

After all has been done, execute the program by executing the **main.py** file.

Screenshots will be added later.
